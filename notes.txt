1. Implement a tensorboard log which shows out of the mask accepted labels how many are same as true label for both original and new mask.
2. Move mask accepted to labeled train
3. Same mask function implemnt 1 and test on 40 labelled set
4. Use barlow weights
5. Use ema weights

python train.py --dataset cifar10 --num-labeled 40 --arch wideresnet --batch-size 64 --lr 0.03 --expand-labels --seed 5 --out results/cifar10@40.5-test1000 --gpu-id 4

try the mahlnobis experiment with equal class representation

Experiment 1:
How accurate is mahlobis as a classifier 
with all labels: 95%
with 1000 labels: doesnt perform well
with 5000 labels: ~95%


Experiment #2:
Make a fixed mahlnobis distance classifier giving it a set of images (5000 for test). Dont add or remove anything.
Mask mahlnobis pred with fxmtch pred.
